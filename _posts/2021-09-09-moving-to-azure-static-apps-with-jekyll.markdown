DustyWright.ME has moved.

The new host is Azure.  The new domain registrar is NameCheap.  The destination is an Azure Static Web App.  Site content is updated in markdown files.  A GitHub Action publishes the Jekyll static site to a configured Azure Static Web App.

Check out the [Tutorial: Publish a Jekyll site to Azure Static Web Apps][azure-static-web-apps] for more info on how to Publish a Jekyll site to Azure Static Web Apps.
